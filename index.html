    <h1>Map Mistakes</h1>
    <div class="d1">
      <h2>Obscuring Information</h2>
      <p>People often make the mistake of leaving out some information based on the data
         map that they use. Each data map is meant to represent information in its own
         way and should be customized to do so. There is no standard method of
         representing data in a data map, because the type of data map you use will
         determine how you need to represent the data to get the most effectiveness out
         of it.

      <h2>Wrong Data Map</h2>
      <p>
        People often use the wrong data maps to represent their information. The purpose
        behind each representation of data speaks loudly to the type of data you want to
        utilize. If you need proportionality, perhaps a proportional data map would be
        useful to you. Or if you want distinctions between regions, maybe a choropleth
        map would tickle your fancy? Either way, it is best to realize the purpose of
        the dataset you are representing and to convey that purpose through the dataset
        by using the purpose as the basis for the data map.
